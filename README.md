This project including design a website and an iOS app to display place searching results.

## For Website
### High Level Design
Create a webpage that allows users to search for places using the Google Places API and display the results on the same page below the form. Once the user clicks on a button to search for place details, the webpage should display several tabs which contain an info table, photos of the place, map and route search form and reviews respectively. the webpage should also support adding places to and removing places from favorites list and posting place info to Twitter.

## For iOS App
### High Level Design
This is a mobile app version of Website. I develop an IOS Mobile application, which allows users to search for place information, save some as favorites, and post on Twitter. Also, I reuse the backend service (node.js script) that I developed for website and follow the same API call requirements.
